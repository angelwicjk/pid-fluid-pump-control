# 🧪 PID Fluid Pump Control System

This project is an Arduino-based closed-loop fluid control system.  
It uses PID control to regulate the flow rate of liquid across multiple pumps in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔧 PID control implementation for stable fluid management
- 🌡️ Real-time flow rate feedback via external sensor
- 💧 Individual valve & pump control for up to 4 pumps
- 🧠 Adaptive control logic with filter and smoothing
- 📡 UART-based data logging (for debugging or visualization)
